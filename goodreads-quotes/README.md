Scrapes all the quotes from a goodreads user's list by two different methods:

1. greads.py - Scraped all the pages of the user's liked list by using HTML scraper and added them to a file.
2. greads_rss.py - Scraped the rss feed of the user's liked quotes and then randomly displayed anyone quote from all the quotes.
