Here I have fetched the hometowns of my friends on facebook using [facebook][1] (using facebook.py). Then using [google][2] (using geopy) I got the lats and lngs corresponding to the hometowns. After which using simplekml I made a kml file so that I can use it on [indiemapper][3] i plotted them on the map. Thus getting the distribution of my friends across India.
