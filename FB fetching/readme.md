Here I have fetched the hometowns of my friends on facebook using [facebook graph API][1] (using facebook.py). Then using [google geocoding service][2] (using geopy) I got the lats and lngs corresponding to the hometowns. After which using [simplekml][4] I made a kml file so that I can use it on [indiemapper][3] i plotted them on the map. Thus getting the distribution of my friends across India.
